<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great Portfolio's on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Portfolio so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a Portfolio from scratch

Of course, no one Portfolio will serve all Developers since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
